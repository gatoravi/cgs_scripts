#cgs_scripts
Scripts that I've been using to run Bioinformatics tools. A lot of these are outdated and from my time on the CGS cluster at WUSTL.
I've added some scripts from my time at MGI as well. I'll try to cleanup some of these when I use them, most of these are pretty 
horrible and only serve as a quick reminder as to how I've used these tools in the past 4 years!
